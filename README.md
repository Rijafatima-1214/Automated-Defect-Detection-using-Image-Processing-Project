# Automated-Defect-Detection-using-Image-Processing-Project
This project develops an automated defect detection system using image processing techniques like grayscale conversion, noise filtering, edge detection, and contour analysis. It detects cracks or surface irregularities in industrial and construction images, featuring a login system, image upload, and defect visualization panel.
